## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I will start by updating the spring and summer animation of rain and fireflies. Currently have fall and winter finished just need to add the other too into the Date checker. Would also like to add some javascript to add gifs to the front page. (You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something and then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as a reference when studying for technical interviews!)

## Lessons Learned:

Separation of Concerns. Realized how much easier it is to add css animations than to add custom javascript to change hover interactions. (No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _wow I actually did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.)
